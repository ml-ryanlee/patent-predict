The method of claim 1 the step of providing a primary layer of thermoplastic material further comprising: heating a polymeric compound and forcing the heated compound through an orifice to form a heated layer; and cooling the heated layer to form a primary layer in a solid state. 3. The method of claim 1 further comprising: aligning the zone heating and compression steps in an off-line operation; and forming the section molded portion in the off-line operation. 4. The method of claim 1 further comprising: aligning the heating, cooling, zone heating and forcing steps in an in-line operation; and forming the section molded portion in the in-line operation. 5. The method of claim 1 the step of zone heating at least one portion, further comprising: applying zone heating of the type selected from the group consisting of: convection heating, radiant heating, conduction heating, infrared heating, and induction heating. 6. The method of claim 1 further comprising: providing a section mold unit having at least one pressing unit and at least one die cavity for forming a section molded feature integral to the multi-layer length of material; and aligning the at least one molten zone with a corresponding die cavity of the section mold in preparation of forcing the molten zone. 7.
